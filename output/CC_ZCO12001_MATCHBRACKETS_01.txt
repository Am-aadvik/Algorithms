1)  Hi friends today i got a call form Monica ma'am she said that we need to change our topic to 'we know our rights, do we also know are responsibilities?'
  
2)  Are we all clear on topic? .. What all we will cover in 'For' and what needs to be covered 'against'   
I think Samar had doubt in the afernoon

My veiw point is :

For 'for' we need to express that yes we know our responsibilities and rights.
For 'against' we need to tell that we are too young to have responsibilities.

If somebody interupts -> Hey Samar, let me complete my thought i will surely come back to you

3) Are we all sticking to 3 for 2 against or does anyone want to change? 

Everybody wants rights but nobody wants responsibilities, but in life both these things are essential

Remeber that each right has a corresponding responsibility for example : 

1) As students we have a right to go to school but our responsibilities are to :
a) Come to school on time
b) Keep the school clean
c) Respect our teachers 
d) Complete our work
2) We right to watch TV but we ahould not watch it for too long
 

Me : 

Today I found a few nice points for against so Samar, actually your point about us being too young is ok but as Meenu maam also pointed out 
that we are in class 5 and we cant stay young forever so I found a few more points so let me share them with you and then you can tell your views                                                                                                              
So I have figured out what we can say to counter Viraj's points 

a) Come to school on time ---> argue : 
we have lots of platforms like (cambly kids,coursera,byju,vedantu and many more) 
where we can take online classes and get taught by any teacher at any time around the world at our convenience
b) Keep the school clean ---> argue : these days we lots of cleaning robots in the market which can clean our school or house as per our wish
c) Respect our teachers 
d) Be friends with everyone      

Viraj --> intoduction and examples -->

Samar --> we can rely on parents for duties we are too young yet, didis at school can do cleaning for us

Shreyan --> didis will get tired, we have to be independant, we are in class 5 and are almost teenagers

Aadvik --> we have lots of platforms like (cambly kids,coursera,byju,vedantu and many more) 
where we can take online classes and get taught by any teacher at any time around the world at our convenience

Vivaan --> too much screen time will give us specs
